- prev: [[seed]]
- seeds are our word for [[zettles]], a part of [[zettlekasten]]. our methodology is to keep things simple but have enough metadata for [[logseq]] to pick up and generate the graph view from.

		- technically the first line has two `::` but [[logseq]] parses it weird so there.
	- this allows us to [[hyperlink]] to another related concept, keep engagement with another, related idea, and give it metadata to sort through. nothing more, nothing less! [[keep it simple]], part of [[lazy engineering]]. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™
	- the reason why tags are at the top is to take advantage of [[logseq]]'s built in tagging system. :3
	- we use a logseq [template](logseq://graph/garden?block-id=64db7d5e-9da5-432a-aa11-f97ae5d113ec) for this, too, for ease of use.
