- the garden here at the [birdcat cafe](https://birdcat.cafe) contains multiple types of flora and fauna.
- the [[gardener]] around here has a system for the [[digital garden]] they maintain. here's a rundown:
	- [seeds](seed) are new pages that have been recently been planted. they're just coming out of their shell, so they may be a little sparse with information and formatting!
	- [saplings](sapling) are pages that have a basic structure and are somewhat reference-able.
	- [trees](tree) are pages that have some additions to basic structure and are presentable. they have become trees of knowledge.
	- [evergreens](evergreen) are pages that have been consistently reliable to reference and have become evergreen
	- [flowers](flower) are planted throughout the garden to bring color to the plant beds.
- do you have recommendations for the garden? reach out to the [[gardener]] or file an [issue on github](https://github.com/TacoWolf/garden/issues)
