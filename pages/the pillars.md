- tenets we try to adhere by in
- from the [[inca]] moral code:
	- [[do not steal]].
	- [[do not lie]].
	- [[be productive]].
- gleaned from the stars:
	- [[make it real]].
	- [[love one another]].
	- [[tell your story]].
	- [[everything is temporary]].
	- [[express yourself]].
	- [[make happy]].
- the pillars may shift and change to withstand the [[sands of time]], but one thing remains true:
	- we love you. ðŸ’š
