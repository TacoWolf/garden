- the [[gardener]] likes doing the following with their notes:
	- follow the [[[[seed]] planting guide]]
	- refrain from using journals
		- the dates aren't that useful for this kind of published work, imo.
		- i use journals in my personal logseq notes, though!
	- plant lots of [[flower]]s to break up monotony.
		- like [[easter eggs]]!
	- stick to [[lowercase]] as much as possible.
		- this helps keep things looking uniform and helps tags work better in [[logseq]] so we don't have to fight with conflicting pages because of capitalization.
