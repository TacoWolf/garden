  [[verse 2]]
  look at him, look at her, they've got a million likes
  You better figure out how to multiply, divide
  Numbers are out to get you
  They'll kill you if they get through
  Numbers, ooh
  
  [[chorus]]
  i hear the sadness in your laughter
  so call on me and tell me what you need
  Just call on me and tell me what you need
