  there's always a number that'll make you feel bad about yourself
  you try to measure up, try to measure up to somebody else
  numbers are out to get you
  numbers are out to get you
  numbers, ooh
  
  they say that you're too short to join the team
  and your IQ's too low for poetry
  numbers are out to get you
  numbers are out to get you
  numbers, ooh
  
  [[verse]] 2
  look at him, look at her, they've got a million likes
  you better figure out how to multiply, divide
  numbers are out to get you
  they'll kill you if they get through
  numbers, ooh
  
  [[chorus]]
  i hear the sadness in your laughter
  so call on me and tell me what you need
  just call on me and tell me what you need
