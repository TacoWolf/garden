- zettlekasten is a german word meaning "slip box".
- zettlekasten is a note taking system. it was popularized by [sonkhe ahrens' "how to take smart notes"](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) by documenting the way that [niklas luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) was able to use the original zettlekasten method to write so prolificly.
- the original zettlekastens were card files consisting of small pieces of information stored on note cards kept in card filing cabinets.
	- these small pieces of information are called [[zettles]].
	- [[zettles]] are usually linked together by ids/references to create a mental network of information.
	- card files were eventually used as inspiration for [[hyperlink]]-based [[personal knowledge management]] software.
	- after completing a zettle, the idea is to put it away in the slip boxes for safekeeping.
