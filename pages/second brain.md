- **prev:** [[personal knowledge management]]
- second brain is a shorthand phrase for your own personal system of note-taking that lives outside of your own head. it is committed information down outside of you that becomes easier to manipulate because you've put it down. you've [made it real]([[make it real]]).
- ### further reading
	- tiago forte has really good videos on how to manage your second brain. he even wrote a book on it! i haven't read it myself, but his videos are really good. the course he offers is a little pricey, though.

	- jorge medina has really good notes on tiago's work [here](https://newsletter.thejorgemedina.com/p/youre-not-lacking-creativity-youre).
		- > The core concept of the book revolves around the CODE Framework, which stands for:
			- Capture - Keep what resonates
			- Organize - Save for actionability
			- Distill - Find the essence
			- Express - Show your work
		- > Another framework from Tiago is the **PARA Framework**, which stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. He explains it in detail in his book “**The PARA Method”**; but the key takeaway is **intentionality**.
	- maggie appleton has some notes on tiago's work as well, you can read that [here](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). but i wanted to highlight something she updated
		- > I also find the metaphor of a “second brain” troubling in that it doesn't speak to the significance of [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) and [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) in how human cognition works. Filling up a “digital brain” as if it were a filing cabinet is highly unlikely to lead to meaningful knowledge
		  and wisdom.
		- > Some of the content below is good, sensible advice  for managing your digital information, but it is not groundbreaking or life changing. It also isn't based in much scientific evidence for what 
		  makes people effective thinkers, writers, and creators.
		- > As Andy Matuschak poetically [pointed out](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv)
			- > "people who write extensively about note-writing rarely have a serious context of use."
