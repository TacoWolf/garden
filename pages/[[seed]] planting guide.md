tags:: #seed #zettlekasten #[[digital garden]]

- prev: [[seed]]
- seeds are our word for [[zettles]], a part of [[zettlekasten]]. my methodology is to keep things simple but have enough metadata for [[logseq]] to pick up and generate the graph view from.
- # seed format
	- ```
	  tags::
	  prev:
	  [content]
	  next:
	  ```
	- this allows us to [[hyperlink]] to another related concept, keep engagement with another, related idea, and give it metadata to sort through. nothing more, nothing less! [[keep it simple]], part of [[lazy engineering]]. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™
	- the reason why tags are at the top is to take advantage of [[logseq]]'s built in tagging system. :3
	- we use a logseq [template](logseq://graph/garden?block-id=64db7d5e-9da5-432a-aa11-f97ae5d113ec) for this, too, for ease of use.
