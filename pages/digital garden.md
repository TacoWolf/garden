- digital gardens, according to [maggie appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) are organized around "contextual relationships and associative links". i personally believe [[logseq]] conduces itself really well to the topography-based bi-directionality of the web, especially since you can publish the whole thing as a [single page app](how to upload a logseq graph that's synchronized to github pages and also publish it to the internet) and link to individual pages within it *and* visualize your thoughts as a graph instantly.
