- i personally believe [[logseq]] conduces itself really well to the topography-based bi-directionality of the web, especially since you can publish the whole thing as a single page app and link to individual pages within it. see [[how to upload a logseq graph that's synchronized to github pages and also publish it to the internet]] for more info.
